**Summary**

This usecase explains how to deploy and use a custom AI copilot built
with Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search to support customer-facing roles,
such as financial client advisors. The copilot streamlines daily work by
summarizing past client meetings, providing financial insights, and
enabling conversational data queries, ultimately improving customer
satisfaction, retention, and productivity. The document walks learners
through provisioning Azure resources using Azure Developer CLI (azd up),
processing and uploading sample data, verifying deployed services such
as App Service, Cosmos DB, SQL Database, Azure Storage, and Foundry
projects, and configuring authentication for secure access. Users then
explore the deployed web application and test sample prompts to retrieve
client insights, such as past concerns, asset details, and financial
trends. The lab concludes with cleanup steps for deleting the resource
group. Overall, the guide provides an end-to-end hands-on experience for
building and deploying a working copilot application in Azure.
