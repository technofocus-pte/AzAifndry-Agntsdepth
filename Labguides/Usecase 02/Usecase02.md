# Usecase 02- Modernize your code with agents with Microsoft Foundry 

**Scenario: Modernizing Large Data Estates for Contoso**

Contoso, a global enterprise managing vast amounts of historical data,
faces significant challenges while modernizing its legacy data estate.
Over the years, the organization has accumulated thousands of files
written in multiple outdated query dialects. With missing documentation
and limited expertise in these legacy languages, analyzing and
maintaining their systems has become increasingly difficult.

Modernization efforts require translating all legacy queries into a
modern, standardized alternative—a process that is typically slow,
manual, and error-prone. Engineers often spend substantial time
reverse-engineering business logic, increasing the risk of errors that
can affect data integrity and downstream analytics. In addition, the
limited availability of specialists familiar with older languages
increases costs and creates long-term dependencies on niche skills.

To address these challenges, **Nathan Rigby**, an experienced Software
Developer at Contoso, plays a key role in maintaining and modernizing
the company’s critical systems. Nathan leverages the **Modernize Your
Code Solution Accelerator**, powered by **Microsoft Foundry agents**, to
automate and streamline the translation of outdated code. These
intelligent agents analyze legacy queries, extract underlying business
logic, and convert them into modern, optimized equivalents with high
accuracy.

By offloading complex translation and analysis tasks to Foundry agents,
Nathan significantly reduces manual workload and removes repetitive,
error-prone processes. This frees him to focus on higher-value
engineering tasks—such as performance tuning, building new features, and
advancing Zava’s modernization roadmap.

With the combined power of the solution accelerator and Microsoft
Foundry agents, Zava accelerates its modernization journey, ensures
high-quality and consistent code translation, and builds a scalable,
future-ready data environment.

By adopting the Modernize Your Code Solution Accelerator, Zava
accelerates its migration efforts, ensures consistent and accurate
translations, and builds a scalable path forward for modernizing its
entire data environment.

**Introduction**

Modernizing legacy codebases is one of the most challenging tasks for
organizations with large and outdated data estates. Over the years,
companies like **Zava** have accumulated thousands of SQL queries and
scripts across multiple legacy dialects such as Informix, Netezza,
Teradata, and other outdated systems. These queries lack proper
documentation, rely on deprecated syntax, and require niche expertise to
interpret and migrate. Manually modernizing such code is slow,
error-prone, and heavily dependent on specialized engineers.

To address these challenges, Zava adopts the **Modernize Your Code
Solution Accelerator**, powered by **Microsoft Foundry agents**, which
provide intelligent, automated assistance for analyzing, translating,
and modernizing legacy SQL code. These agents understand legacy logic,
extract business rules, translate them into modern standards, and ensure
consistency across large-scale migrations. By integrating Foundry’s
agent-driven capabilities into their modernization workflow, Zava
accelerates its migration journey while significantly reducing manual
effort and technical risk.

**Objectives**

- Understand how Microsoft Foundry agents assist in code modernization
  by analyzing legacy SQL dialects and generating optimized modern
  equivalents.

- Set up required Azure services including resource providers, resource
  groups, Foundry, Container Apps, Cosmos DB, and supporting components
  using Azure Developer CLI.

- Create and configure an environment using GitHub Codespaces to run the
  Modernize-your-code Solution Accelerator.

- Deploy and verify modernization components such as backend, frontend,
  and Foundry project within Azure.

- Upload and translate legacy SQL files using the accelerator’s workflow
  and review the conversion output.

- Observe real-time batch processing that shows how legacy files are
  queued, processed, and made available for download.

- Download and validate translated modern SQL code, ensuring translation
  accuracy and completeness.

- Clean up deployed Azure resources safely after completing the lab.

**Summary**

In this use case, you learned how Zava modernizes large and complex
legacy SQL codebases using the **Modernize Your Code Solution
Accelerator** powered by **Microsoft Foundry agents**. You began by
preparing Azure services and configuring a GitHub Codespaces environment
to run the accelerator. You then deployed the required Azure resources,
validated their availability, and explored how Foundry agents help
translate outdated SQL files into modern, standardized formats.

Using the provided modernization workflow, you uploaded legacy SQL
files, executed translations, tracked their processing, and accessed the
converted outputs. This demonstrated how Foundry agents reduce manual
effort, eliminate dependency on niche legacy expertise, and enhance
overall translation accuracy.

By the end of the lab, you gained hands-on experience with agent-driven
code transformation, explored scalable modernization architecture, and
successfully completed the end-to-end modernization process. This
foundation equips you to accelerate large-scale modernization
initiatives using Microsoft Foundry.
